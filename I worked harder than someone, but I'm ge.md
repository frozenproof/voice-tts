Time is precious, and everything we do need time. 

Yet we feel burnt out, we invested time and we don't get much payments, whether it's happiness or an item we wanted so much.

Why don't I start it now? Investing time in something that I never did? People keep saying to keep going at my jobs because you might find something some days.

But when is that some days? They never tell, cause that some days is for the people who trying to blind me with their big talks.

Remember, I decide my own actions. I do this because I want to do this, and I have a plan with assessment to find out where I am in the grand schemes of life.

Flawed or not, we just have to keep going. A mistake teaches us more than a book or lies. We will have to accept defeats and earn more successes.

Be braver and more selfish, don't wait for a miracle or experiences. Experience now! If tired, have a rest now and earn the rights for that rest with planning.

Doesn't have to be 10 years, or 10 months. 10 hours from now, what is going to be done? The answer is the plan.
